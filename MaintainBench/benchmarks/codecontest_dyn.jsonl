{"task_id": "codeContest/10-1", "raw_problem": "El Psy Kongroo.\n\nOmkar is watching Steins;Gate.\n\nIn Steins;Gate, Okabe Rintarou needs to complete n tasks (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5). Unfortunately, he doesn't know when he needs to complete the tasks.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Time travel will now happen according to the following rules:\n\n  * For each k = 1, 2, \u2026, n, Okabe will realize at time b_k that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k (a_k < b_k). \n\n  * When he realizes this, if k-th task was already completed at time a_k, Okabe keeps the usual flow of time. Otherwise, he time travels to time a_k then immediately completes the task.\n\n  * If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).\n\n  * Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again.\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.\n\nThere is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place. Omkar loves this scene and wants to know how many times Okabe will time travel before this scene takes place. Find this number modulo 10^9 + 7. It can be proven that eventually all n tasks will be completed and so the answer always exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of tasks that Okabe needs to complete.\n\nn lines follow. The k-th of these lines contain two integers a_k and b_k (1 \u2264 a_k < b_k \u2264 2n) \u2014 the time at which Okabe needs to complete the k-th task and the time that he realizes this respectively. All 2n of these times are distinct (so every time from 1 to 2n inclusive appears exactly once in the input).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 n) \u2014 the size of the set s of tasks that lead to the funny scene.\n\nThe last line contains t integers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t \u2014 (1 \u2264 s_k \u2264 n, the numbers s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_t are distinct) \u2014 the set s of tasks.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of times that Okabe time travels until all tasks in the set s are simultaneously completed, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n2\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1 2\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n10 12\n3 7\n4 6\n2 9\n5 8\n1 11\n3\n2 4 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\n\nInput\n\n\n16\n31 32\n3 26\n17 19\n4 24\n1 28\n15 21\n12 16\n18 29\n20 23\n7 8\n11 14\n9 22\n6 30\n5 10\n25 27\n2 13\n6\n3 8 2 5 12 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n138\n\nNote\n\nFor the first sample, all tasks need to be completed in order for the funny scene to occur.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task.

Unfortunately, he doesn't know when he needs to complete the tasks.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Time travel will now happen according to the following rules:\n\n  * For each k = 1, 2, \u2026, n, Okabe will realize at time b_k that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k (a_k < b_k). \n\n  * When he realizes this, if k-th task was already completed at time a_k, Okabe keeps the usual flow of time. Otherwise, he time travels to time a_k then immediately completes the task.\n\n  * If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).\n\n  * Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again.\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.\n\nThere is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place.

If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change). Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again. There is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place. Omkar loves this scene and wants to know how many times Okabe will time travel before this scene takes place. Find this number modulo 10^9 + 7.

{"task_id": "codeContest/11-1", "raw_problem": "Omkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

Thus, the largest enjoyment value that they can reach is 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 8 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 9 starting at city 5 can reach only city 5. Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4.

Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4.

{"task_id": "codeContest/11-2", "raw_problem": "Omkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

{"task_id": "codeContest/11-4", "raw_problem": "Omkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are n cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \u2265 v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, \u2026, e_n (1 \u2264 e_i \u2264 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3.

All letters must be uppercase.\n\nIf you print UNIQUE, then print n additional lines with n characters in each line, such that the i-th character in the j^{th} line is S if the tile in row i and column j of the mastapeece is sinoper, and G if it is glaucous. \n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4\nS...\n..G.\n....\n...S\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nMULTIPLE\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\nS.....\n....G.\n..S...\n.....S\n....G.\nG.....\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNONE\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10\n.S....S...\n..........\n...SSS....\n..........\n..........\n...GS.....\n....G...G.\n..........\n......G...\n..........\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nUNIQUE\nSSSSSSSSSS\nSGGGGGGGGS\nSGSSSSSSGS\nSGSGGGGSGS\nSGSGSSGSGS\nSGSGSSGSGS\nSGSGGGGSGS\nSGSSSSSSGS\nSGGGGGGGGS\nSSSSSSSSSS\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n.\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNONE\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, Omkar can make the mastapeeces\n\nSSSS\n\nSGGS\n\nSGGS\n\nSSSS\n\nand \n\nSSGG\n\nSSGG\n\nGGSS\n\nGGSS.\n\nFor the second test case, it can be proven that it is impossible for Omkar to add tiles to create a mastapeece.\n\nFor the third case, it can be proven that the given mastapeece is the only mastapeece Omkar can create by adding tiles.\n\nFor the fourth test case, it's clearly impossible for the only tile in any mosaic Omkar creates to be adjacent to two tiles of the same color, as it will be adjacent to 0 tiles total. .", "raw_solution": "```python\n    #\u53ea\u67092\u79cd\u5408\u6cd5\n#1. \u56db\u4e2a\u4e00\u7ec4\n\"\"\"\nSSGG\nSSGG\nGGSS\nGGSS\n\"\"\"\n#2.\u4e00\u5c42\u5305\u4e00\u5c42\n\"\"\"\nSSSS\nSGGS\nSGGS\nSSSS\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef codeContest_run1(n, grid):\n    grid = [list(row) for row in grid]\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return 'NONE'  # \u5982\u679c n \u662f\u5947\u6570\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7b26\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\n\n    # \u56db\u4e2a\u4e00\u7ec4\u5f62\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\n    def check_four_group(grid):\n        if len(grid) % 4!=0:\n            return None\n        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n        #\u5148\u68c0\u67e5\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5916\u5c42SS\u5757\u5728\u5de6\u4e0a\u89d2\n        if checkSzuo(new_grid):\n            return new_grid\n        #\u518d\u68c0\u67e5\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5916\u5c42GG\u5757\u5728\u5de6\u4e0a\u89d2\n        if checkSyou(grid):\n            return new_grid\n        return None\n    def checkSzuo(grid):\n        for i in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n            for j in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n                if grid[i][j] == 'G' or grid[i][j+1] == 'G' or grid[i+1][j] == 'G' or grid[i+1][j+1] == 'G':\n                    return False\n        for i in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n            for j in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n                grid[i][j]= 'S'\n                grid[i][j+1]= 'S'\n                grid[i+1][j]= 'S'\n                grid[i+1][j+1]= 'S'\n\n        return True\n    def checkSyou(grid):\n        for i in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n            for j in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n                if grid[i][j] == 'S' or grid[i][j+1] == 'S' or grid[i+1][j] == 'S' or grid[i+1][j+1] == 'S':\n                    return False\n        for i in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n            for j in range(0, len(grid), 4):\n                grid[i][j]= 'G'\n                grid[i][j+1]= 'G'\n                grid[i+1][j]= 'G'\n                grid[i+1][j+1]= 'G'\n        return True\n    # \u4e00\u5c42\u5305\u4e00\u5c42\u5f62\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\n    def check_layer_group(grid):\n        new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n        #print(new_grid)\n        #\u5148\u68c0\u67e5\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5916\u5c42S\u5185\u5c42G\n        if checkWaiS(new_grid):\n            return new_grid\n        #print(\"\u770b\u6765\u4e0d\u80fd\u5916\u5c42S\u5185\u5c42G\")\n        # \u518d\u68c0\u67e5\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5916\u5c42G\u5185\u5c42S\n        if checkWaiG(new_grid):\n            return new_grid\n        #print(\"\u770b\u6765\u4e0d\u80fd\u5916\u5c42G\u5185\u5c42S\")\n        return None\n    def checkWaiS(grid):\n        #\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5916\u5c42S\u5185\u5c42G\n        for i in range(0, len(grid)//2):\n            #print(\"i=\",i)\n            #print(\"[len(grid)-i-1]=\", len(grid) -

A completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly 2 tiles of the same color (2 tiles are adjacent if they share a side.)

n \u2264 s).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print YES (case-insensitive), if the farm is ideal, or NO (case-insensitive) otherwise.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n1 1 1\n1 1 2\n100 50 200\n56220 47258 14497\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\n\nFor the first and the second test case, the only possible combination is [1] so there always will be a subsegment with 1 animal but not with 2 animals.", "raw_solution": "```python\n    # \u519c\u573a\u91cc\u6709 s \u53ea\u52a8\u7269\u548c n \u4e2a\u52a8\u7269\u56f4\u680f    \u6ca1\u6709\u7a7a\u56f4\u680f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u56f4\u680f\u6bb5\u4e2d\u52a8\u7269\u603b\u6570\u6070\u597d\u4e3a k \u53ea\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u4e2a\u519c\u573a\u5c31\u662f\u5e78\u8fd0\u519c\u573a\n# \u5982\u679c\u4e00\u4e2a\u519c\u573a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6ca1\u6709\u7a7a\u56f4\u680f\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u5f0f\u90fd\u662f\u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u4e2a\u519c\u573a\u5c31\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u519c\u573a\u3002\ndef codeContest_run1(test_cases):\n    results = []\n\n    for s, n, k in test_cases:\n        # \u5982\u679c k > s\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e78\u8fd0\u519c\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\n        if k > s:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n\n        # \u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e78\u8fd0\u519c\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\n\n        possible = True\n\n\n        #\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5e78\u8fd0\u90a3\u5c31\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\n        #\u524dn-1\u4e2a\u56f4\u680f\u90fd\u653e1\u4e2a\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u56f4\u680f\u653es-(n-1)\u4e2a  \u5982\u679c\u8981\u6c42\u7684n-1<k<s-(n-1),\u90a3\u8be5\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u6070\u4e3ak\u53ea\n        # \u5982\u679c\u5206\u914d\u540e\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u52a8\u7269\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u5730\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6216\u6ca1\u6709\u529e\u6cd5\u4f7f\u67d0\u4e2a\u56f4\u680f\u6070\u597d\u4e3a k\n        # \u68c0\u67e5\u5269\u4f59\u52a8\u7269\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u5230\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u56f4\u680f\u4e2d\n        if n - 1 < k and s - n + 1 > k:\n            possible = False\n\n        #\u5982\u679ck \u662f\u5947\u6570\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bcf\u6bb5\u90fd\u653e2\u4e2a\uff0c\u80af\u5b9a\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\n        if k%2!=0:\n            if s%2==0 and s>=n*2:\n                possible = False\n\n        #\u6bd4\u5982\u8bb2k=8,\u8fde\u7eed\u653e7\u4e2a1 \u518d\u653e\u4e00\u4e2an \u518d\u653e7\u4e2a1 \u518d\u653en \u53ea\u8981n>8 \u90a3\u5c31\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\n        zuNum = n//k#\u53ef\u4ee5\u653e\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u7ec4\n        yu = n%k #\u8fd8\u4f59\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\n        put1Num = zuNum*(k-1)+yu#\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u653e1\n        if zuNum!=0:\n            zhuNum = (s - put1Num) // zuNum\n            if zhuNum > k:\n                possible = False\n\n\n\n        if possible:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n\n    return results\n\n\n#print(codeContest_run1([(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (100, 50, 200), (56220, 47258, 14497)]))\n#print((codeContest_run1([(10, 5, 3), (15, 5, 5), (20, 10, 8)])))  #(10, 5, 3)\u5e94\u8be5\u662fno 2 2 2 2 2    (15, 5, 5),\u5e94\u8be5\u662fno 3 3 3 3 3    (20, 10, 8)\u5e94\u8be5\u662fno \u8fde\u7eed5\u4e2a1 \u4e00\u4e2a11 \u5728\u8fde\u7eed4\u4e2a1\n#print(codeContest_run1([(1000000000000000000, 500000000000000000, 1), (50, 10, 5), (999999999, 333333333, 333333333)]))#(50, 10, 5)\u5e94\u8be5\u662fno 1 1 1 1 21 21 1 1 1 1\uff0c\u4e09\u8005\u8f93\u51fa\u90fd\u662fno\u8bf4\u660e\u6211\u8003\u8651\u7684\u51e0\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5df2\u7ecf\u8db3\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\n#print(codeContest_run1([(100, 100, 1), (100, 100, 100), (100, 100, 50)]))#\u90fd\u5e94\u8be5\u662fyes,\u53ea\u67091\u79cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u5f0f\n#print(codeContest_run1([(100, 10, 20), (100, 10, 11), (100, 10, 10)]))#(100, 10, 20)(100, 10, 11), (100, 10, 10) \u5e94\u8be5\u662fno \u524d9\u4e2a\u653e1 \u7b2c10\u4e2a\u653e91\uff0c\n     ```", "raw_test_input": ["assert codeContest_run1([(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (100, 50, 200), (56220, 47258, 14497)]) == ['YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']", "assert codeContest_run1([(10, 5, 3), (15, 5, 5), (20, 10, 8)]) == ['NO', 'NO', 'NO']", "assert codeContest_run1([(1000000000000000000, 500000000000000000, 1), (50, 10, 5), (999999999, 333333333, 333333333)]) == ['NO', 'NO', 'NO']", "assert codeContest_run1([(100, 100, 1), (100, 100, 100), (100, 100, 50)]) == ['YES', 'YES', 'YES']", "assert codeContest_run1([(100, 10, 20), (100, 10, 11), (100, 10, 10)]) == ['NO', 'NO', 'NO']"], "new_problem": "In a large agricultural company, there are multiple farms, each with a different number of animals and pens.

Each item has an integer price. If Monocarp's chosen item has price x, then he can trade it for any item (exactly one item) with price not greater than x+k.\n\nMonocarp initially has n items, the price of the i-th item he has is a_i. The character Monocarp is trading with has m items, the price of the i-th item they have is b_i. Monocarp can trade with this character as many times as he wants (possibly even zero times), each time exchanging one of his items with one of the other character's items according to the aforementioned constraints.

Each item has an integer price. If Monocarp's chosen item has price x, then he can trade it for any item (exactly one item) with price not greater than x+k.\n\nMonocarp initially has n items, the price of the i-th item he has is a_i. The character Monocarp is trading with has m items, the price of the i-th item they have is b_i. Monocarp can trade with this character as many times as he wants (possibly even zero times), each time exchanging one of his items with one of the other character's items according to the aforementioned constraints. Note that if Monocarp gets some item during an exchange, he can trade it for another item (since now the item belongs to him), and vice versa: if Monocarp trades one of his items for another item, he can get his item back by trading something for it.\n\nYou have to answer q queries. Each query consists of one integer, which is the value of k, and asks you to calculate the maximum possible total cost of items Monocarp can have after some sequence of trades, assuming that he can trade an item of cost x for an item of cost not greater than x+k during each trade.

{"task_id": "codeContest/31-2", "raw_problem": "Polycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.\n\nThere are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.\n\nPolycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test suite.\n\nNext comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 timer \u2264 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n5 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n5 2\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n6 1\n1 -1 3\n0 -1 9\n0 1 7\n-1 0 1\n-1 1 9\n-1 -1 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image> Picture from examples\n\nFirst example: \n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2), it does not detonate any other mine since k=0. \n  * 1 second: we explode the mine at the cell (0, 1), and the mine at the cell (0, 0) explodes itself. \n  * 2 second: we explode the mine at the cell (1, 1), and the mine at the cell (1, 0) explodes itself.\n\n\n\nSecond example:\n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2) we get: \n\n<image>\n\n  * 1 second: the mine at coordinate (0, 0) explodes and since k=2 the explosion detonates mines at the cells (0, 1) and (1, 0), and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell (1, 1) and there are no mines left on the field. .", "raw_solution": "```python\ndef codeContest_run1(test_cases):\n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n    import heapq\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, k, mines = case\n\n        # Sort mines by their explosion time\n        mines.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n\n        # Create a map from coordinates to mine index\n        coord_to_index = {(x, y): i for i, (x, y, _) in enumerate(mines)}\n\n        # Initialize parent array for Union-Find\n        parent = [i for i in range(n)]\n        rank = [1] * n\n\n        def find(u):\n            while parent[u] != u:\n                parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]  # Path compression\n                u = parent[u]\n            return u\n\n        def union(u, v):\n            u_root = find(u)\n            v_root = find(v)\n            if u_root == v_root:\n                return False\n            if rank[u_root] < rank[v_root]:\n                parent[u_root] = v_root\n            else:\n                parent[v_root] = u_root\n                if rank[u_root] == rank[v_root]:\n                    rank[u_root] += 1\n            return True\n\n        # Process mines in order of their explosion time\n        min_seconds = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            x, y, timer = mines[i]\n            if find(i) != i:\n                continue  # Already detonated by another mine\n\n            # Detonate this mine and all mines in its cross\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append((x, y))\n            detonated = set()\n            detonated.add((x, y))\n\n            while queue:\n                cx, cy = queue.popleft()\n                for dx in range(-k, k + 1):\n                    if dx != 0:\n                        nx, ny = cx + dx, cy\n                        if (nx, ny) in coord_to_index:\n                            idx = coord_to_index[(nx, ny)]\n                            if find(idx) != i:\n                                union(i, idx)\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n                                detonated.add((nx, ny))\n\n                for dy in range(-k, k + 1):\n                    if dy != 0:\n                        nx, ny = cx, cy + dy\n                        if (nx, ny) in coord_to_index:\n                            idx = coord_to_index[(nx, ny)]\n                            if find(idx) != i:\n                                union(i, idx)\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n                                detonated.add((nx, ny))\n\n            min_seconds = max(min_seconds, timer)\n\n        results.append(min_seconds)\n\n    return results\n```", "raw_test_input": ["assert codeContest_run1([(5, 0, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 4), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 3), (2, 2, 9)])]) == [9]", "assert codeContest_run1([(5, 2, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 4), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 3), (2, 2, 9)])]) == [9]", "assert codeContest_run1([(6, 1, [(1, -1, 3), (0, -1, 9), (0, 1, 7), (-1, 0, 1), (-1, 1, 9), (-1, -1, 7)])]) == [1]", "assert codeContest_run1([(1, 0, [(0, 0, 1)])]) == [1]", "assert codeContest_run1([(3, 0, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 3)])]) == [3]"], "new_problem": "Polycarp's Minesweeper game has been updated with new features.

{"task_id": "codeContest/31-3", "raw_problem": "Polycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.\n\nThere are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.\n\nPolycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test suite.\n\nNext comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 timer \u2264 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n5 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n5 2\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n6 1\n1 -1 3\n0 -1 9\n0 1 7\n-1 0 1\n-1 1 9\n-1 -1 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image> Picture from examples\n\nFirst example: \n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2), it does not detonate any other mine since k=0. \n  * 1 second: we explode the mine at the cell (0, 1), and the mine at the cell (0, 0) explodes itself. \n  * 2 second: we explode the mine at the cell (1, 1), and the mine at the cell (1, 0) explodes itself.\n\n\n\nSecond example:\n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2) we get: \n\n<image>\n\n  * 1 second: the mine at coordinate (0, 0) explodes and since k=2 the explosion detonates mines at the cells (0, 1) and (1, 0), and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell (1, 1) and there are no mines left on the field. .", "raw_solution": "```python\ndef codeContest_run1(test_cases):\n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n    import heapq\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, k, mines = case\n\n        # Sort mines by their explosion time\n        mines.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n\n        # Create a map from coordinates to mine index\n        coord_to_index = {(x, y): i for i, (x, y, _) in enumerate(mines)}\n\n        # Initialize parent array for Union-Find\n        parent = [i for i in range(n)]\n        rank = [1] * n\n\n        def find(u):\n            while parent[u] != u:\n                parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]  # Path compression\n                u = parent[u]\n            return u\n\n        def union(u, v):\n            u_root = find(u)\n            v_root = find(v)\n            if u_root == v_root:\n                return False\n            if rank[u_root] < rank[v_root]:\n                parent[u_root] = v_root\n            else:\n                parent[v_root] = u_root\n                if rank[u_root] == rank[v_root]:\n                    rank[u_root] += 1\n            return True\n\n        # Process mines in order of their explosion time\n        min_seconds = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            x, y, timer = mines[i]\n            if find(i) != i:\n                continue  # Already detonated by another mine\n\n            # Detonate this mine and all mines in its cross\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append((x, y))\n            detonated = set()\n            detonated.add((x, y))\n\n            while queue:\n                cx, cy = queue.popleft()\n                for dx in range(-k, k + 1):\n                    if dx != 0:\n                        nx, ny = cx + dx, cy\n                        if (nx, ny) in coord_to_index:\n                            idx = coord_to_index[(nx, ny)]\n                            if find(idx) != i:\n                                union(i, idx)\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n                                detonated.add((nx, ny))\n\n                for dy in range(-k, k + 1):\n                    if dy != 0:\n                        nx, ny = cx, cy + dy\n                        if (nx, ny) in coord_to_index:\n                            idx = coord_to_index[(nx, ny)]\n                            if find(idx) != i:\n                                union(i, idx)\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n                                detonated.add((nx, ny))\n\n            min_seconds = max(min_seconds, timer)\n\n        results.append(min_seconds)\n\n    return results\n```", "raw_test_input": ["assert codeContest_run1([(5, 0, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 4), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 3), (2, 2, 9)])]) == [9]", "assert codeContest_run1([(5, 2, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 4), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 3), (2, 2, 9)])]) == [9]", "assert codeContest_run1([(6, 1, [(1, -1, 3), (0, -1, 9), (0, 1, 7), (-1, 0, 1), (-1, 1, 9), (-1, -1, 7)])]) == [1]", "assert codeContest_run1([(1, 0, [(0, 0, 1)])]) == [1]", "assert codeContest_run1([(3, 0, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 3)])]) == [3]"], "new_problem": "Polycarp is playing an advanced version of Minesweeper where mines are organized in a grid, and each cell can contain multiple mines with different timers.

Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.\n\nThere are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.\n\nPolycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test suite.\n\nNext comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 timer \u2264 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n5 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n5 2\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n6 1\n1 -1 3\n0 -1 9\n0 1 7\n-1 0 1\n-1 1 9\n-1 -1 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image> Picture from examples\n\nFirst example: \n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2), it does not detonate any other mine since k=0. \n  * 1 second: we explode the mine at the cell (0, 1), and the mine at the cell (0, 0) explodes itself. \n  * 2 second: we explode the mine at the cell (1, 1), and the mine at the cell (1, 0) explodes itself.\n\n\n\nSecond example:\n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2) we get: \n\n<image>\n\n  * 1 second: the mine at coordinate (0, 0) explodes and since k=2 the explosion detonates mines at the cells (0, 1) and (1, 0), and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell (1, 1) and there are no mines left on the field. .", "raw_solution": "```python\ndef codeContest_run1(test_cases):\n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n    import heapq\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, k, mines = case\n\n        # Sort mines by their explosion time\n        mines.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n\n        # Create a map from coordinates to mine index\n        coord_to_index = {(x, y): i for i, (x, y, _) in enumerate(mines)}\n\n        # Initialize parent array for Union-Find\n        parent = [i for i in range(n)]\n        rank = [1] * n\n\n        def find(u):\n            while parent[u] != u:\n                parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]  # Path compression\n                u = parent[u]\n            return u\n\n        def union(u, v):\n            u_root = find(u)\n            v_root = find(v)\n            if u_root == v_root:\n                return False\n            if rank[u_root] < rank[v_root]:\n                parent[u_root] = v_root\n            else:\n                parent[v_root] = u_root\n                if rank[u_root] == rank[v_root]:\n                    rank[u_root] += 1\n            return True\n\n        # Process mines in order of their explosion time\n        min_seconds = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            x, y, timer = mines[i]\n            if find(i) != i:\n                continue  # Already detonated by another mine\n\n            # Detonate this mine and all mines in its cross\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append((x, y))\n            detonated = set()\n            detonated.add((x, y))\n\n            while queue:\n                cx, cy = queue.popleft()\n                for dx in range(-k, k + 1):\n                    if dx != 0:\n                        nx, ny = cx + dx, cy\n                        if (nx, ny) in coord_to_index:\n                            idx = coord_to_index[(nx, ny)]\n                            if find(idx) != i:\n                                union(i, idx)\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n                                detonated.add((nx, ny))\n\n                for dy in range(-k, k + 1):\n                    if dy != 0:\n                        nx, ny = cx, cy + dy\n                        if (nx, ny) in coord_to_index:\n                            idx = coord_to_index[(nx, ny)]\n                            if find(idx) != i:\n                                union(i, idx)\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n                                detonated.add((nx, ny))\n\n            min_seconds = max(min_seconds, timer)\n\n        results.append(min_seconds)\n\n    return results\n```", "raw_test_input": ["assert codeContest_run1([(5, 0, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 4), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 3), (2, 2, 9)])]) == [9]", "assert codeContest_run1([(5, 2, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 4), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 3), (2, 2, 9)])]) == [9]", "assert codeContest_run1([(6, 1, [(1, -1, 3), (0, -1, 9), (0, 1, 7), (-1, 0, 1), (-1, 1, 9), (-1, -1, 7)])]) == [1]", "assert codeContest_run1([(1, 0, [(0, 0, 1)])]) == [1]", "assert codeContest_run1([(3, 0, [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 3)])]) == [3]"], "new_problem": "Polycarp is developing a new version of the Minesweeper game and needs to ensure the game handles errors gracefully.
