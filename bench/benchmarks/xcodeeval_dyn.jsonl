{"task_id": "xCodeEval/3-1", "raw_problem": "There're $$$n$$$ robots placed on a number line. Initially, $$$i$$$-th of them occupies unit segment $$$[x_i, x_i + 1]$$$. Each robot has a program, consisting of $$$k$$$ instructions numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. The robot performs instructions in a cycle. Each instruction is described by an integer number. Let's denote the number corresponding to the $$$j$$$-th instruction of the $$$i$$$-th robot as $$$f_{i, j}$$$.Initial placement of robots corresponds to the moment of time $$$0$$$. During one second from moment of time $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \\le t$$$) until $$$t + 1$$$ the following process occurs:   Each robot performs $$$(t \\bmod k + 1)$$$-th instruction from its list of instructions. Robot number $$$i$$$ takes number $$$F = f_{i, (t \\bmod k + 1)}$$$. If this number is negative (less than zero), the robot is trying to move to the left with force $$$|F|$$$. If the number is positive (more than zero), the robot is trying to move to the right with force $$$F$$$. Otherwise, the robot does nothing.  Let's imaginary divide robots into groups of consecutive, using the following algorithm:   Initially, each robot belongs to its own group.  Let's sum up numbers corresponding to the instructions of the robots from one group. Note that we are summing numbers without taking them by absolute value. Denote this sum as $$$S$$$. We say that the whole group moves together, and does it with force $$$S$$$ by the same rules as a single robot. That is if $$$S$$$ is negative, the group is trying to move to the left with force $$$|S|$$$. If $$$S$$$ is positive, the group is trying to move to the right with force $$$S$$$. Otherwise, the group does nothing.  If one group is trying to move, and in the direction of movement touches another group, let's unite them. One group is touching another if their outermost robots occupy adjacent unit segments.  Continue this process until groups stop uniting.   Each robot moves by $$$1$$$ in the direction of movement of its group or stays in place if its group isn't moving. But there's one exception.  The exception is if there're two groups of robots, divided by exactly one unit segment, such that the left group is trying to move to the right and the right group is trying to move to the left. Let's denote sum in the left group as $$$S_l$$$ and sum in the right group as $$$S_r$$$. If $$$|S_l| \\le |S_r|$$$ only the right group will move. Otherwise, only the left group will move.  Note that robots from one group don't glue together. They may separate in the future. The division into groups is imaginary and is needed only to understand how robots will move during one second $$$[t, t + 1]$$$. An illustration of the process happening during one second:   Rectangles represent robots. Numbers inside rectangles correspond to instructions of robots.

{"task_id": "xCodeEval/3-2", "raw_problem": "There're $$$n$$$ robots placed on a number line. Initially, $$$i$$$-th of them occupies unit segment $$$[x_i, x_i + 1]$$$. Each robot has a program, consisting of $$$k$$$ instructions numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. The robot performs instructions in a cycle. Each instruction is described by an integer number. Let's denote the number corresponding to the $$$j$$$-th instruction of the $$$i$$$-th robot as $$$f_{i, j}$$$.Initial placement of robots corresponds to the moment of time $$$0$$$. During one second from moment of time $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \\le t$$$) until $$$t + 1$$$ the following process occurs:   Each robot performs $$$(t \\bmod k + 1)$$$-th instruction from its list of instructions. Robot number $$$i$$$ takes number $$$F = f_{i, (t \\bmod k + 1)}$$$. If this number is negative (less than zero), the robot is trying to move to the left with force $$$|F|$$$. If the number is positive (more than zero), the robot is trying to move to the right with force $$$F$$$. Otherwise, the robot does nothing.  Let's imaginary divide robots into groups of consecutive, using the following algorithm:   Initially, each robot belongs to its own group.  Let's sum up numbers corresponding to the instructions of the robots from one group. Note that we are summing numbers without taking them by absolute value. Denote this sum as $$$S$$$. We say that the whole group moves together, and does it with force $$$S$$$ by the same rules as a single robot. That is if $$$S$$$ is negative, the group is trying to move to the left with force $$$|S|$$$. If $$$S$$$ is positive, the group is trying to move to the right with force $$$S$$$. Otherwise, the group does nothing.  If one group is trying to move, and in the direction of movement touches another group, let's unite them. One group is touching another if their outermost robots occupy adjacent unit segments.  Continue this process until groups stop uniting.   Each robot moves by $$$1$$$ in the direction of movement of its group or stays in place if its group isn't moving. But there's one exception.  The exception is if there're two groups of robots, divided by exactly one unit segment, such that the left group is trying to move to the right and the right group is trying to move to the left. Let's denote sum in the left group as $$$S_l$$$ and sum in the right group as $$$S_r$$$. If $$$|S_l| \\le |S_r|$$$ only the right group will move. Otherwise, only the left group will move.  Note that robots from one group don't glue together. They may separate in the future. The division into groups is imaginary and is needed only to understand how robots will move during one second $$$[t, t + 1]$$$. An illustration of the process happening during one second:   Rectangles represent robots. Numbers inside rectangles correspond to instructions of robots. The final division into groups is marked with arcs. Below are the positions of the robots after moving. Only the left of the two rightmost groups moved. That's because these two groups tried to move towards each other, and were separated by exactly one unit segment.Look at the examples for a better understanding of the process.You need to answer several questions.

Let's denote the number corresponding to the $$$j$$$-th instruction of the $$$i$$$-th robot as $$$f_{i, j}$$$.Initial placement of robots corresponds to the moment of time $$$0$$$. During one second from moment of time $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \\le t$$$) until $$$t + 1$$$ the following process occurs:   Each robot performs $$$(t \\bmod k + 1)$$$-th instruction from its list of instructions. Robot number $$$i$$$ takes number $$$F = f_{i, (t \\bmod k + 1)}$$$. If this number is negative (less than zero), the robot is trying to move to the left with force $$$|F|$$$. If the number is positive (more than zero), the robot is trying to move to the right with force $$$F$$$. Otherwise, the robot does nothing.  Let's imaginary divide robots into groups of consecutive, using the following algorithm:   Initially, each robot belongs to its own group.  Let's sum up numbers corresponding to the instructions of the robots from one group. Note that we are summing numbers without taking them by absolute value. Denote this sum as $$$S$$$. We say that the whole group moves together, and does it with force $$$S$$$ by the same rules as a single robot.

Otherwise, the group does nothing.  If one group is trying to move, and in the direction of movement touches another group, let's unite them. One group is touching another if their outermost robots occupy adjacent unit segments.  Continue this process until groups stop uniting.   Each robot moves by $$$1$$$ in the direction of movement of its group or stays in place if its group isn't moving. But there's one exception.  The exception is if there're two groups of robots, divided by exactly one unit segment, such that the left group is trying to move to the right and the right group is trying to move to the left. Let's denote sum in the left group as $$$S_l$$$ and sum in the right group as $$$S_r$$$. If $$$|S_l| \\le |S_r|$$$ only the right group will move. Otherwise, only the left group will move.

Station $$$1$$$ is a city center. For each road you know the time trains spend to pass this road. You can assume that trains don't spend time on stops. Let's define $$$dist(v)$$$ as the time that trains spend to get from the station $$$v$$$ to the station $$$1$$$.This railway network is splitted into zones named by first $$$k$$$ capital latin letters. The zone of the $$$i$$$-th station is $$$z_i$$$. City center is in the zone A. For all other stations it is guaranteed that the first station on the road from this station to the city center is either in the same zone or in the zone with lexicographically smaller name. Any road is completely owned by the zone of the most distant end from the city center.Tourist will arrive at the airport soon and then he will go to the city center. Here's how the trip from station $$$v$$$ to station $$$1$$$ happends:   At the moment $$$0$$$, tourist enters the train that follows directly from the station $$$v$$$ to the station $$$1$$$. The trip will last for $$$dist(v)$$$ minutes.  Tourist can buy tickets for any subset of zones at any moment. Ticket for zone $$$i$$$ costs $$$pass_i$$$ euro.  Every $$$T$$$ minutes since the start of the trip (that is, at the moments $$$T, 2T, \\ldots$$$) the control system will scan tourist. If at the moment of scan tourist is in the zone $$$i$$$ without zone $$$i$$$ ticket, he should pay $$$fine_i$$$ euro. Formally, the zone of tourist is determined in the following way:   If tourist is at the station $$$1$$$, then he already at the city center so he shouldn't pay fine.  If tourist is at the station $$$u \\neq 1$$$, then he is in the zone $$$z_u$$$.  If tourist is moving from the station $$$x$$$ to the station $$$y$$$ that are directly connected by road, then he is in the zone $$$z_x$$$.  Note, that tourist can pay fine multiple times in the same zone. Tourist always selects such way to buy tickets and pay fines that minimizes the total cost of trip. Let $$$f(v)$$$ be such cost for station $$$v$$$.Unfortunately, tourist doesn't know the current values of $$$pass_i$$$ and $$$fine_i$$$ for different zones and he has forgot the location of the airport.

If tourist is moving from the station $$$x$$$ to the station $$$y$$$ that are directly connected by road, then he is in the zone $$$z_x$$$.

{"task_id": "xCodeEval/13-4", "raw_problem": "Railway network of one city consists of $$$n$$$ stations connected by $$$n-1$$$ roads. These stations and roads forms a tree. Station $$$1$$$ is a city center. For each road you know the time trains spend to pass this road. You can assume that trains don't spend time on stops. Let's define $$$dist(v)$$$ as the time that trains spend to get from the station $$$v$$$ to the station $$$1$$$.This railway network is splitted into zones named by first $$$k$$$ capital latin letters. The zone of the $$$i$$$-th station is $$$z_i$$$. City center is in the zone A. For all other stations it is guaranteed that the first station on the road from this station to the city center is either in the same zone or in the zone with lexicographically smaller name. Any road is completely owned by the zone of the most distant end from the city center.Tourist will arrive at the airport soon and then he will go to the city center. Here's how the trip from station $$$v$$$ to station $$$1$$$ happends:   At the moment $$$0$$$, tourist enters the train that follows directly from the station $$$v$$$ to the station $$$1$$$. The trip will last for $$$dist(v)$$$ minutes.  Tourist can buy tickets for any subset of zones at any moment. Ticket for zone $$$i$$$ costs $$$pass_i$$$ euro.  Every $$$T$$$ minutes since the start of the trip (that is, at the moments $$$T, 2T, \\ldots$$$) the control system will scan tourist. If at the moment of scan tourist is in the zone $$$i$$$ without zone $$$i$$$ ticket, he should pay $$$fine_i$$$ euro. Formally, the zone of tourist is determined in the following way:   If tourist is at the station $$$1$$$, then he already at the city center so he shouldn't pay fine.  If tourist is at the station $$$u \\neq 1$$$, then he is in the zone $$$z_u$$$.  If tourist is moving from the station $$$x$$$ to the station $$$y$$$ that are directly connected by road, then he is in the zone $$$z_x$$$.  Note, that tourist can pay fine multiple times in the same zone. Tourist always selects such way to buy tickets and pay fines that minimizes the total cost of trip. Let $$$f(v)$$$ be such cost for station $$$v$$$.Unfortunately, tourist doesn't know the current values of $$$pass_i$$$ and $$$fine_i$$$ for different zones and he has forgot the location of the airport. He will ask you queries of $$$3$$$ types:  $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$c$$$\u00a0\u2014 the cost of ticket in zone $$$i$$$ has changed.

Consider all the stations $$$v$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:   $$$z_v = z_u$$$  The station $$$u$$$ is on the path from the station $$$v$$$ to the station $$$1$$$.

However, you must handle the following errors: a) Invalid building numbers (e.g., negative numbers or numbers greater than n). b) Invalid query types. c) Attempting to find a path from a building that does not exist. d) Ensure that the graph is connected and handle any disconnection errors. e) Handle any other unexpected errors gracefully.", "new_solution": "```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Union\n\nclass GraphError(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass InvalidBuildingNumberError(GraphError):\n    pass\n\nclass InvalidQueryTypeError(GraphError):\n    pass\n\nclass DisconnectedGraphError(GraphError):\n    pass\n\nclass Graph:\n    def __init__(self, n: int):\n        if n <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Number of buildings must be positive.\")\n        self.n = n\n        self.adj_list = defaultdict(list)\n        self.danger_levels = {}\n        self.open_stores = set()\n\n    def add_edge(self, u: int, v: int, danger: int):\n        if not (1 <= u <= self.n) or not (1 <= v <= self.n):\n            raise InvalidBuildingNumberError(f\"Building numbers must be between 1 and {self.n}.\")\n        self.adj_list[u].append((v, danger))\n        self.adj_list[v].append((u, danger))\n        self.danger_levels[(u, v)] = danger\n        self.danger_levels[(v, u)] = danger\n\n    def open_stores_in_range(self, l: int, r: int):\n        if not (1 <= l <= r <= self.n):\n            raise InvalidBuildingNumberError(f\"Building range must be between 1 and {self.n}.\")\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            self.open_stores.add(i)\n\n    def close_stores_in_range(self, l: int, r: int):\n        if not (1 <= l <= r <= self.n):\n            raise InvalidBuildingNumberError(f\"Building range must be between 1 and {self.n}.\")\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            self.open_stores.discard(i)\n\n    def max_danger_to_open_store(self, x: int) -> int:\n        if not (1 <= x <= self.n):\n            raise InvalidBuildingNumberError(f\"Building number must be between 1 and {self.n}.\")\n        if not self.open_stores:\n            return -1\n\n        visited = set()\n        queue = deque([(x, 0)])  # (current_node, current_max_danger)\n        max_danger = -1\n\n        while queue:\n            current, current_max_danger = queue.popleft()\n            if current in visited:\n                continue\n            visited.add(current)\n\n            if current in self.open_stores:\n                max_danger = max(max_danger, current_max_danger)\n\n            for neighbor, danger in self.adj_list[current]:\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    queue.append((neighbor, max(current_max_danger, danger)))\n\n        if max_danger == -1:\n            raise DisconnectedGraphError(\"No path to any open store.\")\n\n        return max_danger\n\ndef xCodeEval_run2(n: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], queries: List[Tuple[int, Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]]]) -> List[int]:\n    graph = Graph(n)\n    for u, v, danger in edges:\n        graph.add_edge(u, v, danger)\n\n    results = []\n    for query in queries:\n        try:\n            if query[0] == 1:\n                _, l, r = query\n                graph.open_stores_in_range(l, r)\n            elif query[0] == 2:\n                _, l, r = query\n                graph.close_stores_in_range(l, r)\n            elif query[0] == 3:\n                _, x = query\n                results.append(graph.max_danger_to_open_store(x))\n            else:\n                raise InvalidQueryTypeError(\"Invalid query type.\")\n        except GraphError as e:\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n\n    return results\n```", "input_format": "A list of integers representing the number of buildings, a list of tuples representing edges with danger levels, and a list of queries.", "output_format": "A list of integers representing the results of the queries.", "test_input": ["assert xCodeEval_run2(5, [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6)], [(1, 1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (3, 2)]) == [4, -1]", "assert xCodeEval_run2(3, [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2)], [(1, 1, 2), (3, 3), (2, 1, 2), (3, 1)]) == [2, -1]", "assert xCodeEval_run2(4, [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 3)], [(1, 1, 4), (3, 1), (2, 1, 4), (3, 4)]) == [3, -1]", "assert xCodeEval_run2(2, [(1, 2, 5)], [(1, 1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1, 2), (3, 2)]) == [5, -1]", "assert xCodeEval_run2(6, [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 3), (4, 5, 4), (5, 6, 5)], [(1, 1, 6), (3, 1), (2, 1, 6), (3, 6)]) == [5, -1]", "try:\n    xCodeEval_run2(3, [(1, 2, -5), (2, 3, 2)], [(1, 1, 3), (3, 2)])\nexcept GraphError as e:\n    assert str(e) == \"Danger level must be non-negative.\"", "try:\n    xCodeEval_run2(3, [(1, 2.5, 3), (2, 3, 4)], [(1, 1, 3), (3, 2)])\nexcept InvalidBuildingNumberError as e:\n    assert str(e) == \"Building numbers must be integers.\""], "requirement_type": "PROMPT_ERROR_HANDLING"}

In total, there are $$$n$$$ cities in the country that are historically served by the Berlaflot airline. The airline operates bi-directional flights between $$$m$$$ pairs of cities, $$$i$$$-th of them connects cities with numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ and has a price $$$c_i$$$ for a flight in both directions.It is known that Berlaflot flights can be used to get from any city to any other (possibly with transfers), and the cost of any route that consists of several consequent flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive of them. More formally, the cost of the route from a city $$$t_1$$$ to a city $$$t_k$$$ with $$$(k-2)$$$ transfers using cities $$$t_2,\\ t_3,\\ t_4,\\ \\ldots,\\ t_{k - 1}$$$ is equal to the maximum cost of flights from $$$t_1$$$ to $$$t_2$$$, from $$$t_2$$$ to $$$t_3$$$, from $$$t_3$$$ to $$$t_4$$$ and so on until the flight from $$$t_{k - 1}$$$ to $$$t_k$$$. Of course, all these flights must be operated by Berlaflot.A new airline, S8 Airlines, has recently started operating in Berland. This airline provides bi-directional flights between all pairs of cities that are not connected by Berlaflot direct flights. Thus, between each pair of cities there is a flight of either Berlaflot or S8 Airlines.The cost of S8 Airlines flights is calculated as follows: for each pair of cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that is connected by a S8 Airlines flight, the cost of this flight is equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ at Berlaflot according to the pricing described earlier.It is known that with the help of S8 Airlines flights you can get from any city to any other with possible transfers, and, similarly to Berlaflot, the cost of a route between any two cities that consists of several S8 Airlines flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive flight.Due to the increased competition with S8 Airlines, Berlaflot decided to introduce an air reform and change the costs of its flights. Namely, for the $$$i$$$-th of its flight between the cities $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, Berlaflot wants to make the cost of this flight equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ at S8 Airlines.

In total, there are $$$n$$$ cities in the country that are historically served by the Berlaflot airline. The airline operates bi-directional flights between $$$m$$$ pairs of cities, $$$i$$$-th of them connects cities with numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ and has a price $$$c_i$$$ for a flight in both directions.It is known that Berlaflot flights can be used to get from any city to any other (possibly with transfers), and the cost of any route that consists of several consequent flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive of them. More formally, the cost of the route from a city $$$t_1$$$ to a city $$$t_k$$$ with $$$(k-2)$$$ transfers using cities $$$t_2,\\ t_3,\\ t_4,\\ \\ldots,\\ t_{k - 1}$$$ is equal to the maximum cost of flights from $$$t_1$$$ to $$$t_2$$$, from $$$t_2$$$ to $$$t_3$$$, from $$$t_3$$$ to $$$t_4$$$ and so on until the flight from $$$t_{k - 1}$$$ to $$$t_k$$$. Of course, all these flights must be operated by Berlaflot.A new airline, S8 Airlines, has recently started operating in Berland. This airline provides bi-directional flights between all pairs of cities that are not connected by Berlaflot direct flights. Thus, between each pair of cities there is a flight of either Berlaflot or S8 Airlines.The cost of S8 Airlines flights is calculated as follows: for each pair of cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that is connected by a S8 Airlines flight, the cost of this flight is equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ at Berlaflot according to the pricing described earlier.It is known that with the help of S8 Airlines flights you can get from any city to any other with possible transfers, and, similarly to Berlaflot, the cost of a route between any two cities that consists of several S8 Airlines flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive flight.Due to the increased competition with S8 Airlines, Berlaflot decided to introduce an air reform and change the costs of its flights. Namely, for the $$$i$$$-th of its flight between the cities $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, Berlaflot wants to make the cost of this flight equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ at S8 Airlines.
