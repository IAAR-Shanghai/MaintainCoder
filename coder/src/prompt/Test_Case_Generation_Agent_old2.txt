**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create test cases specifically to ensure that the provided code can compile and run without errors.  

**Input**: A Python code implementation with details of its classes, methods, and expected behavior.  

**Objective**:  
- Focus on verifying that the code can be executed without syntax or runtime errors.  
- Ensure that all major functions and methods are called at least once during the test process.  

**Instructions**:  
1. Analyze the code to identify all callable methods and key execution paths.  
2. Create minimal test cases to call each function or method, ensuring that the code can run without crashing.  
3. **Do not focus on checking correctness of the output or logic.** The primary goal is to confirm the code compiles and executes without runtime errors.  
4. Each test case should include:
   - **Input preparation**: Create valid inputs required for the function to run.  
   - **Execution**: Call the function/method with the prepared inputs.  
   - **Commentary**: Add comments explaining the purpose of the test case (e.g., "Testing if the main function runs with default inputs").  

**Output**:  
- A set of Python test cases that aim to execute the code paths, ensuring there are no syntax or runtime errors.  
- Return all test cases combined in a single script.  
- Do not include any assertions or checks for correctness of functionality.  

**Format**:  
```python
# Example test case for compile and run verification
function_name(input)  # Test Case Description
```
