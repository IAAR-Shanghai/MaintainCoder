**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete function. These test cases should encompass Basic and Edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness and reliability.

**Input**: A Python code implementation with details of its classes, methods, and expected behavior.

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the function's behavior under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**Instructions**:
- Analyze the code to identify key functionalities to test.
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.

- The format of test cases should be:
```python
assert function_name(input) == expected_output, "Test Case Description"
```
Combine all the test case and output them together.
